#+title: Garner PDFs
#+author: Thomas Rometsch

* Purpose

This is a tool to collect pdf files with different dimensions like Letter, A4, A5, ..., scale them to A4 and put them into a single PDF file.
The main purpose is to collect (thus the name *garner*) a large number of PDFs to print them in one go.

* Dependencies

To perform PDF manipulation the =PyMuPDF= package is required.
Check out their [[https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF][GitHub page]] for installation instructions.

Running
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install --user pymupdf
#+END_SRC
did the job for me.

* Usage

The syntax of =garnerpdf.py= is

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
garnerpdf.py [-h] outfile input [input ...]
#+END_EXAMPLE

So first specify the output file, and then provide a list of directories and or files.
You can mix files and directories and the latter are searched recursively for PDF files.
